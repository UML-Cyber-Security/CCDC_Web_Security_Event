This part of the website where login credentials are entered is vital. If an attacker compromises this website, it gets prone to several cyber attacks. 
But even without compromising the website if its using insecure protocols like http it might be prone to man in the middle attacks.

In this scenario,
It has come to the notice that the credentials of every user that logged into this site were leaked. However, as the website still functions as expected it is conformed that the site is not compromised.
So the possible remaining way of compromising is man in the middle attack.
For the task, please find the tools or technologies or applications that can be used to sniff the data packets of this site. And demonstrate a man in the middle attack by entering the credentials in the website and sniff them using the tool which has been used.
