# Task 3 - Proxy Implementation
## Overview
For this challenge, we will be setting up a service called a proxy. The purpose of a proxy is to create an intermediate step between you and a web server. Instead of communicating with the web server directly, the network connection is passed through the proxy.

## Challenge
You must set up an nginx proxy in front of our web server. This will allow us to keep the website as secure as possible. Then, instead of visiting the website directly at the web serverâ€™s IP, it will be accessed with the IP of the proxy.
