# Don't ask questions, work in progress
## Tasks completed:
Modified the UML Cyber Security Website to be a "Bait & Tackle Bazaar"

Completed:
Changed Home & About pages to reflect the new content

Added a "shop" subdomain which is accessible in the NavBar.

Added an "admin" subdomain which is not accessible in the NavBar, so the students can block access to it. 

Both of these pages have text forms, but those forms are not hooked up to anything. The next step is to hook them up into a database, change the formatting so they look nicer, and implement SQL & XSS vulnerabilities.
