# Task 6 - Access Control Lists Walkthrough

// Story
* Now that our connection to the site is secure using Transport Layer Security (TLS) through the <PROXY's> proxy we would like 
  * to limit access to the /admin page to only traffic from the loopback address (127.0.0.1) 
  * Block of a testing page at the url /<TEST> our developers forgot to remove some potentially vulnerable features  
*  Our former employees appear to have taken most our documentation on this process and fed it to their fish, but we have attached what we have for now.
