This part of the website where login credentials are entered is vital. If an attacker compromises this website, it gets prone to several cyber attacks. 
But if this website uses weak protocols (like http) it might be prone to man in the middle attacks.
It has come to the notice that the credentials of every user that logged into this site were leaked. However, as the website still functions as expected it is conformed that the site is not compromised.
So the possible remaining way of compromising is man in the middle attack.
For the task, please find the tools or technologies or applications that can be used to sniff the data packets of this site.

PS: even log in credentials are communicated as data packets.
