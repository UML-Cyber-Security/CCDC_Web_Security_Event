## **Why they want to do this**
Now that we have a proxy, we want to solve the original problem of having unencrypted traffic flow through the network. It doesn't matter how many defenses we have in place, if there is unencrypted traffic, all of our hard work goes to waste. So, let's make sure that this work is worth it by encrypting the traffic. We can do this by adding [Transport Layer Security (TLS)](https://www.internetsociety.org/deploy360/tls/basics/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwmZejBhC_ARIsAGhCqndNx4umx51pjz-Ti0loVf-rExEJ6RGV_DNB3b2J7sO2dVVGCbeY7kQaAgwtEALw_wcB) capabilities to the proxy. We don't want any unauthorized parties to be able to listen in on our traffic and do what you did in the first task.
